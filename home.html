	Racism is still one of the major issues that persists, particularly with the younger generations. According to Merriam Webster, racism is a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race. Furthermore, it states that racial discrimination or prejudice is an attitude or behavior that reflects and promotes this belief. This may result in a variety of prejudices and forms of discrimination based on skin tone, ethnicity, or cultural background. Racism can widen social gaps between the people  and erect obstacles in the way of opportunity, creating conditions that lead to the unfair treatment of communities. In addition to confronting discriminatory conduct and stereotypes, fighting racism also means confronting the underlying systems that uphold inequality, encouraging empathy, and building an accepting community that celebrates diversity.
