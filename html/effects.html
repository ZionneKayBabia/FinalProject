	How does this affect an individual?
</h3>
<p>
	A 2015 research study shows that racism is twice as likely to affect mental health than physical health.
</p>

<ul id="luh">
	<li> Emotional </li>
	 Damaging effect on mental health: distress, PTSD, insomnia, depression, anxiety, fear, low self-esteem etc. It humiliates, dehumanises and goes to their dignity, resulting to changes in behaviour or sometimes, suicidal death.

	<li> Financial </li>
	  Medical costs of mental health issues, paying for property loss, damage, or repair. Change of employment or housing. These factors can cause the victim to leave the country, causing more financial requirement.
</ul>

<ul id="uhm">
	<li> Physical </li>
	Physical injuries and their effects which may lead to ill physical and mental health. Loss of or damage ro property that may lead to premature death.

	<li> Social </li>
	Fear of new places or joining new groups which lead to isolation and low trust in others. This disconnects themselves from the community, lacking of confidence when in public spaces, and gives the sense of fear when engaging with strangers.
</ul>

	How does this affect our society?
</h3>

 <ul id="luh">
	<li> Ripple Effect of Racism</li>
	Racism can impact on a victim, their family and community, especially when the response of the leaders, neighbours, and authorities is poor. Members of the same minority groups can react as if the same is happening to them. Therefore, communities can become isolated and torn apart.

	<li> The Role of Bystanders & Allies </li>
	  Failing to intervene can worsen a target/victim's psychological response, causing them to feel helpless and excluded, increasing social isolation. This can result to racists to feel like racism is accepted and supported by the society. Therefore, intervening helps with the challenging and changing norms that make racism acceptable. It can significantly reduce the impact of a racist incident.
