	What are some of the reasons behind this issue?
</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Influence From peers </li>
	  Most people are influenced by people who they hangout with everyday. Especially their close friends.

	<li> Lack of Education </li>
	  Some lack education about racial equalities.

	<li> Xenophobia</li>
	  Dislike of or prejudice against people from other countries.

	<li> Judgemental people </li>
	  We often put labels on people.
	
	<li> Bias </li>
	  Bias can lead to discrimination/racism. An example is when a certain person starts to be racist because his/her idol does the same.
	
	<li> Historical Legacy of Colonialism and Slavery </li>
 	  There are histrocial inequalities that have been passed down and embedded in institutions and mindsets.

	<li> Stereotyping </li>
	  Simplifies and generalizes a group of people. Oftenly in the negative light.

	<li> Social media </li>
	  One of the drawbacks of social media is that it can impose standards on what people should believe. The norms regarding how to perceive an individual or a group of individuals based on their ethnicity is one of these.
